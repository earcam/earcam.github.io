# Equality

Some points on equality, examples in Java, broadly applicable to OOP languages.

* [Auto-generated equals/hashCode is unnecessary with clean code](#equality-autogen)  
* [Don't test for referential equality in equals methods](#equality-referential)
* [Best practice Java equality a violation of SRP](#equality-srp)
* [Avoid implementing equals/hashCode just for the sake of assertEquals](#equality-assert)

<font style="color:green">
&#x263c; Note:</font> I will be covering *what* should actually be compared within an `equals` method under a later post covering Identity and Entity/Value types.


## <a name="equality-autogen"></a>Auto-generated equals/hashCode is unnecessary with clean code
Don't use your IDE's mindless autogen or [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/EqualsAndHashCode.html)'s shiny magic - to do so is to indicative of equality-obsessive-compulsive-disorder or cyclomatic-complexity-addiction.




## <a name="equality-referential"></a>Don't test for referential equality in equals methods

<pre><code class="java">
		@Override
		public boolean equals(Object obj)
		{
			// type/null checking ...
			if(this == obj) {
				return true;
			}
			// property checking ...
		}
</code></pre>

How often do you check if an object is equal to itself?  Seriously, think about it...  Consider what's actually going on inside different collections - in any collection **not equals** is a far likelier outcome the **equals**.

The only possible (and certainly false) excuse for checking referential equality would be performance...  The reason this is a false assumption is that the purported optimisation is
for a single incredibly narrow case.

Much better would be to measure and acknowledge that the `equals` is incredibly expensive to calculate and then revisit your design...  Failing that then 
simply implementing a cached-on-demand hashCode which is then used as the first equality check after type/null.

<pre><code class="java">
		@Override
		public boolean equals(Object obj)
		{
			// type/null checking ...
			if(hashCode() != obj.hashCode()) {
				return false;
			}
			// property checking ...
		}
</code></pre>
This resolves for inverse case which is, hopefully, far broader.

So favour simplicity, and only if proven to positively impact overall performance, then favour the cached `hashCode` alternative. 




## <a name="equality-srp"></a>"Best practice" Java equality a violation of SRP

In 2012 I was lucky enough to get a free ticket to [JFokus](jfokus.se) in Sweden (thanks to the [LJC](http://londonjavacommunity.co.uk "London Java Community")). &nbsp;[Kevlin Henney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevlin_Henney) gave a fascinating talk, among many insights, describing Java as a Class-Oriented, not Object-Oriented language.

One of the things he highlighted was the so called best practice for overriding Java's [Object.equals(Object)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals-java.lang.Object- "javadoc"), typically:

<pre><code class="java">
	import java.util.Objects;

	class Person {
	
		private String name;
		private Integer number;
	
		@Override
		public boolean equals(Object obj)
		{
			if(obj instanceof Person) {
				Person other = ((ThisClass) obj;
				return Objects.equals(name, that.getName())
					&& Objects.equals(number, that.getNumber());
			}
			return false;
		}

		@Override
		public int hashCode()
		{
			return Objects.hash(name, number);
		}
	}
</code></pre>

The vulgarity in the `equals` method above can be accounted for by it's violation of [SRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle "Single Responsibility Principle") - it deals with the type/null checking, casting and also compares the field(s).

We can rewrite this, without any control flow branching, just boolean ANDs, as:

<pre><code class="java">
	import java.util.Objects;

	class Person {
	
		private String name;
		private Integer number;
	
		@Override
		public boolean equals(Object other)
		{
			return that instanceof Person && equals((Person) other);
		}

		public boolean equals(Person that)
		{
			return that != null &&
				&& Objects.equals(name, that.getName()) &&
				Objects.equals(number, that.getNumber());
		}

		@Override
		public int hashCode()
		{
			return Objects.hash(name, number);
		}
	}
</code></pre>

<font style="color:green">
&#x263c; Note:</font> Java 7 introduces [java.util.Objects](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Objects.html "javadoc"), removing the tedious null checking of fields.  Additionally it provides [Objects.hash(Object ... values)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Objects.html#hash%28java.lang.Object...%29 "javadoc").  If you're trapped on an older version of the JDK then implement/copy this utility. 

<font style="color:green">
&#x263c; Note:</font> IIRC Kevlin's original example uses a trinary in the overloaded `equals`, as:
<pre><code class="java">return (other instanceof Person) ? equals((Person)other) : false;</code></pre>


### Some observations:

*	The previous method's branching is still present, the `if` statement has been folded into a boolean condition. The important part is that the equality test is solved by delegation - this division of responsibility is intuitive and a great improvement in readability
*	In the vast majority of cases the argument will be cast to the actual type, thus the JVM will invoke the more specific overload, forgoing a needless type check and cast
*	Incidentally the `instanceof` call will evaluate to false when the argument is null

So not only is this way clearer, simpler and better design, it's also more efficient. 




##  <a name="equality-assert"></a>Avoid implementing equals/hashCode just for the sake of assertEquals

Unless the production code demands it (e.g. usage in a hash map or published as a model from an API), don't avoid implementing `equals`/`hashCode` in the first place.

Use [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) matchers instead, compose with `allOf`.

&#x263c; TODO:</font> Add code for custom property matcher, with example for equality without equals...
